#General summaries 

```{r}
practice_data %>%

    mean_age = mean(age),
    median_age = median(age),
    mean_salary = mean(salary),
    median_salary = median(salary)
    )
```

Notes: 
Grouped mutate
Summarizing collapses groups into single data points. In contrast, using mutate() in conjuntion with group_by() will retain all original data points and add new variables computed within groups.

```{r}
practice_data %>%
  group_by(
    quarter
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    hs = round(health_score, digits = 0)
  )
```

Notes:
Window functions
The previous example used mean() to compute the mean within each group, which was then subtracted from the observed max tempurature. mean() takes n inputs and produces a single output.

Window functions, in contrast, take n inputs and return n outputs, and the outputs depend on all the inputs. There are several categories of window functions; you’re most likely to need ranking functions and offsets, which we illustrate below.


```{r}
practice_data %>%
  group_by(quarter, sex) %>%
  mutate(
    salary_rank = min_rank(salary)
  )
```

This sort of ranking is useful when filtering data based on rank

```{r}
practice_data %>%
  group_by(quarter, sex) %>%
    filter(
   min_rank(salary) < 2  
    ) 
```

Notes:

Strings and Factors: The most frequent operation involving strings is to search for an exact match. You can use str_detect to find cases where the match exists (often useful in conjunction with filter), and you can use str_replace to replace an instance of a match with something else (often useful in conjunction with mutate)

str_detect(string_vec, "^i think") - Starts with i think
str_detect(string_vec, "i think$") - ends with i think
str_detect(string_vec,"[Bb]ush")
str_detect(string_vec, "^[0-9][a-zA-Z]")
str_detect(string_vec, "7.11") The character . matches any character.
Some characters are “special”. These include [ and ], ( and ), and .. If you want to search for these, you have to indicate they’re special using \. Unfortunately, \ is also special, so things get weird.
str_detect(string_vec, "\\[") - search for an actual character i.e, the open bracket [

*imp: select(-contains"")

example for separate and str_replace:

data_marj = 
  table_marj %>%
  select(-contains("P Value")) %>% #
  pivot_longer(
    -State,
    names_to = "age_year", 
    values_to = "percent") %>%
    
  separate(age_year, into = c("age", "year"), sep = "\\(") %>% #seperating the age_year into age and year, seperated by an open parenthesis. sep = "\\(" means separate from where there is an (. We have to give \\ since ( is a special character.
  
  mutate(
    year = str_replace(year, "\\)", ""), #After the above step, year had a ) and we would want to remove that. We can do that by replacing that with a blank. 
    str_replace(year, "\\)", "") is replacing ) with a black. Again we used \\ since ) is a spl character.
    percent = str_replace(percent, "[a-c]$", ""), there is a character a,b, or c at the end of the percent values which we would want to remove. To remove, use str_replace, and [a-c]$ shows the presence of a-c at the end of the percent string and we want to replace that with a blank.
    percent = as.numeric(percent)) %>%
  filter(!(State %in% c("Total U.S.", "Northeast", "Midwest", "South", "West")))
  
#Interactivity

practice_data %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  select(quarter, race, health_score) %>%
  mutate(
    race = factor(race)
  ) %>%
  group_by(
    race, quarter
  ) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_score = mean(health_score)
  ) %>%
  plot_ly(
   x = ~quarter, y = ~ mean_score, color = ~race, type = "bar"
  )


```{r}
age_function = function(x){
  tibble(
    mean = mean(x),
    minimum = min(x),
    maximum = max(x)
  )
}
```

```{r}
a = practice_data %>%
  select(
    age, salary, health_score
  )
```

```{r}
age_function(x = a$age)
age_function(x = a$health_score)
age_function(x = a$salary)

```

```{r}
practice_data2 = practice_data %>%
  filter(
    employee_id %in% 1:3
  ) %>%
  select(
    employee_id, quarter, age, hospital_visit, salary, health_score
  )
```

#Nesting

```{r}
employee_nest = practice_data2 %>%
  nest(
    data = quarter:health_score
  ) #nesting the age,hosputal visit, salary and health score within the employee id and quarter. dATA is a list of data frames.
```

Is the list column really a list? Let's check?

```{r}
employee_nest %>%
  pull(data)
``` 

```{r}
employee_nest$data[[1]]
```

Unnesting 

```{r}
employee_nest %>%
  unnest() #back to the original data
```

Trying useful things with the list column: 

```{r}
employee_1 = employee_nest$data[[1]]
lm(health_score ~ age, data = employee_1)
```

```{r}
employee_2 = employee_nest$data[[2]]
lm(health_score ~ age, data = employee_2)
```
Instead of repeating it again and again for all the three employees, we could:

```{r}
lm(health_score ~ age, data = employee_nest$data[[1]])
lm(health_score ~ age, data = employee_nest$data[[2]])
```
We could use a loop:

```{r}
output = vector("list", length = 3)

for (i in 1:3) {
  output[[i]] = lm(health_score ~ age, data = employee_nest$data[[i]])
}
```


```{r}
lm_fun = function(x) {
  lm(health_score ~ age, data = x)
} #written a function for the linear model
```

```{r}
output = vector("list", length = 3)

for (i in 1:3) {
  output[[i]] = lm_fun(x = employee_nest$data[[i]])
}
```

Use map:

```{r}
output = map(employee_nest$data, lm_fun)
```

Linear models:

```{r}
fit = lm(health_score ~ age + salary + hospital_visit + sex + race, data = practice_data )
summary(fit)
coef(fit)
summary(fit)$coef
```

```{r}
fit %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

```

Diagnostics for linear models:

```{r}
modelr::add_residuals(practice_data, fit) 
```


```{r}
modelr::add_predictions(practice_data, fit) 
```

Nesting
```{r}
fit_interaction = lm(health_score ~ sex + age + salary + race + age*sex + hospital_visit, data = practice_data)
fit_interaction %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

Logistic regression:

```{r}
fit_logistic = glm(hospital_visit ~ age + salary, data = practice_data)
fit_logistic %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate)
  ) %>%
  select(
    term, estimate, p.value, OR
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```
