#General summaries 

```{r}

    median_age = median(age),
    mean_salary = mean(salary),
    median_salary = median(salary)
    )
```

Notes: 
Grouped mutate
Summarizing collapses groups into single data points. In contrast, using mutate() in conjuntion with group_by() will retain all original data points and add new variables computed within groups.

```{r}
practice_data %>%
  group_by(
    quarter
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    hs = round(health_score, digits = 0)
  )
```

Extra:
Window functions
The previous example used mean() to compute the mean within each group, which was then subtracted from the observed max tempurature. mean() takes n inputs and produces a single output.

Window functions, in contrast, take n inputs and return n outputs, and the outputs depend on all the inputs. There are several categories of window functions; you’re most likely to need ranking functions and offsets, which we illustrate below.


```{r}
practice_data %>%
  group_by(quarter, sex) %>%
  mutate(
    salary_rank = min_rank(salary)
  )
```

This sort of ranking is useful when filtering data based on rank

```{r}
practice_data %>%
  group_by(quarter, sex) %>%
    filter(
   min_rank(salary) < 2  
    ) 
```
